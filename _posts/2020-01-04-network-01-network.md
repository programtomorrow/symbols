## Network

Computers are only useful when they are connected to other devices: monitors,
keyboards, robot arms, other computers. The ultimate input and output of a
computer is to or from some other machine.

Even without the idea of usefulness, it's difficult to separate the interior of
a computer from a network, for useful computers. My phone, for example,
contains a number of processors associated with various radios, internal
storage, etc. Inside of the case of my chromebook is another little network.

### Questions about networks

* Where are the borders of the network?
* What are the nodes?
* What are the protocols on the network?
* How is time and order represented on the network?
* How are nodes identified and addressed by one another?
* What happens when a component on the network fails?
* What are the limits of the network, and what happens of those limits are exceeded?
