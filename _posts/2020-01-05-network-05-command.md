## Instruction

Messages on a network have some purpose. Even telemetry and metrics have implicit instructions to write or update some database. At the most basic level, we operate devices by giving them instructions.

### Questions about instructions

* What is the effect of the instruction?
* What is the context of the instruction? What are its operands?
* What is the result of the instruction?
* Is the instruction complete in itself? What are the subinstructions executed to fulfill it?
