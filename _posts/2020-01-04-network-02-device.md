## Devices

The things on a network that aren't a network itself are devices. Devices
either do things (mice, monitors, robot arms, disks) or send messages to other
devices. There is no "computer" here, as such - we could replace the computer
and program with a magical spirits or gremlins and the monitors and speakers
and disks and bank accounts would all run just the same.

### Questions about devices

* What is the purpose of the device?
* What other devices does the device know about and need?
* What other devices does the device serve?
* Does the device have peers? How is the device identified? Is it real, or virtual?
* What network lives inside of the device? What network is hidden or represented by the device?
